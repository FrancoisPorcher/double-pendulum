# Modelisation of a Chaotic Double Pendulum with LSTM

In this project I model the behaviour of a Double Pendulum with LSTM, and compare it with a Finite Difference solver.

The interesting aspect with solving partial derivative equations with Deep Neural Networks is that it is extremely fast to generate simulations. It takes a lot of time to train the models, but once it is trained, it is ready.

## Usage


 - Clone the repository
 ```bash
 git clone 'git@github.com:FrancoisPorcher/double-pendulum.git' 
 ```
 - Install dependencies
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 - Run the `main` file! Nothing else to do! (But feel free to explore the other files)
 ```bash
 main.ipynb
 ```

## Conclusion

This was just a test to see how LSTM performs on time series describing the chaotic path of a double pendulum.
Next steps could be to use Deep Reinforcement Learning to find equlibrium points.
