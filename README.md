# Modelisation of a Chaotic Double Pendulum with LSTM

In this project I model the behaviour of a Double Pendulum with LSTM, and compare it with a Finite Difference solver.

The interesting aspect with solving partial derivative equations with Deep Neural Networks is that it is extremely fast to generate simulations. It takes a lot of time to train the models, but once it is trained, it is ready.
